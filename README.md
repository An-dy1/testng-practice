# Notes

- When Rahul runs his @Test, it shows PASSED: [method name], but I don't get that in mine
- TestNG is incorporated in IntelliJ and doesn't require download - just have to include in pom.xml if Maven project
- One class can incorporate several test classes using @Test annotation

## Required to run tests with TestNG?

- Must have @Test annotation
- Followed by method(s)
- Can have several @Test annotations in one class

## TestNG.xml file

- Triggers run
- Whereas Eclipse can auto-generate a TestNG.xml file, IntelliJ doesn't have that feature, so I'm going to add a template in my IntelliJ setup
